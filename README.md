This project presents a real-time lane detection system implemented on a Raspberry Pi, designed to enhance vehicle safety in autonomous driving applications. Lane detection is a crucial feature that helps vehicles maintain proper alignment within road lanes, thereby contributing significantly to road safety and driving efficiency. While many solutions for lane detection exist, this project focuses on the efficient deployment of such systems on low-power, cost-effective edge devices like the Raspberry Pi.

The system integrates both traditional image processing techniques and advanced deep learning models to ensure accurate and reliable detection. OpenCV is used for the core image processing pipeline, enabling real-time lane detection from live video feeds. To support remote monitoring, wireless video streaming is implemented through a Flask-based web server, allowing users to access the video feed via a web browser from any connected device.

A key component of the image preprocessing stage is edge detection, which enhances lane markings in each frame to improve model performance. The deep learning model used in this project is trained on the CULane datasetâ€”a well-known benchmark for lane detection tasks. This dataset includes a wide variety of real-world driving scenarios, such as occlusions, curves, shadows, and different lighting conditions, which helps the model generalize better across various environments.

To streamline development, deployment, and platform compatibility, the entire system is containerized using Docker. This allows for easy updates, consistent environments, and cross-platform support, making the system highly scalable and portable.

By deploying the lane detection system on a Raspberry Pi, this project demonstrates the feasibility of running complex computer vision tasks on low-power embedded systems. It addresses the challenges of maintaining real-time performance and accuracy under different environmental conditions. The outcome highlights the potential of using such systems in advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous vehicles, offering a practical and affordable solution for real-world applications in intelligent transportation.
